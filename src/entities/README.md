All files in this directory are generated by the following command:

```bash
sea generate entity -u 'sqlite:./sqlite.db?mode=rwc' -o src/entities
```

To make changes to entities, add a migration file in `src/migrations`, run the executable to make it applied, then run the above command again to regenerate the entities from the `sqlite.db` file.
